# GeneNameErrors2020

The purpose of this repository is to understand whether gene name errors remain a problem in the scientific literature.

The goal of this work is to screen PubMed Central for MS Excel spreadsheets and search for gene lists and evidence that gene names have been auto-converted to dates and other data types in error.

# Contents

## Software

* gene_names.sh is the script used to screen all the PMC records for Excel spreadsheets and gene name errors.

* comparison.sh is a script used to test the performance of programs to convert spreadsheets to tabular data files

* analyze.sh this is a short script used to process and summarise the results from gene_names.sh script

* read_xls.R is a helper Rscript that executes the readxl function which is very efficient at extracting tabular data from Excel sheets.

## Input data

There are several files like pmc2015.txt which is a list of PMC papers. I
These were generated by searching PMC (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc) with the following strategy:

(genom*[Abstract]) AND ("2015"[Publication Date] : "2015"[Publication Date]) 

The 2015 papers were obtained on the 3rd Sept and the 2016-2019 papers were obtained on the 10th September.
